    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
    <p>Posted by <strong>Laura Jones</strong> on Monday, June 21st 2027</p>
    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
    <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers
        use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
        etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can learn more at <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML>MDN Web Docs.</a></p>
    <h2>Why should you learn HTML?</h2>
    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
